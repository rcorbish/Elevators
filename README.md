# Elevators

This is a node.js script to simulate a bank of elevators. I got annoyed by how badly
the 'smart' elevators in my building worked. To see how difficult it was I attempted
to simulate a busy day at the office: with loads of calls.

It turns out it's not that bad at all - there's enough limits that the degrees of freedom
are pretty low. For example although it may be efficient to kick everyone out at floor 5 
and ask them to continue on - it's not allowed.

Anyway - it's pretty silly: but if you make elevators you can use it for free :)
